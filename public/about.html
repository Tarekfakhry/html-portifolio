<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! my name is Tarek Fakhry and i'm from Egypt, I graduated from law school and was working as a legal affairs employee when i started to learn programming as a hobbie but ended up falling 
  in love with coding and computer science, so i decided to shift careers and become a full fledged programmer soon.
</p>

<p>I first started learning programming in java script then more advanced topics in java, then took some online courses on android developement, then took a CCNA course on network engineering as well
  to get a better understanding on some common topics such as IP,DNS,servers etc.
</p>

<p>My goal is to reach the proffessional level in coding no matter which department i get the luxury of working in and I'm doing my very best to learn everything i can about as many
  topics as possible before specialising in any area of expertise and what I aim for is to become an expert in code optimization and security.
